Reflection seems to solve a lot of problems...

I can loop through all the types within a dll
checking for anything that inherits from a given base class
and then call methods that I know it must have to do work
without knowing anything about the actual implementaiton...

Will need to redirect stdio to files then send those files back
read them in and output them to standard out (or something like that.)
