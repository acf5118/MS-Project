research day mostly, can't use reflection to generate IL and then send those bytes
(although it would be pretty cool), since symbols and other meta data are not stored
or the same on the other end, would only be able to send a simply x + y function over tcp.
Going to need to send the whole program/ exe. That involves writing a program that is run like

testapp.exe <flags> userapp.exe <user variables > which is ugly...
Can't inherit base class main method so that a user could subclass a super class in
PDLib and then have that hid some of the other details.
